# CS532FinalProject

Our project directory has two main folders.

The first is "dataset", which contains a folder "toy", "small", and "medium". Each of these contains text files, which make up the datasets we used for testing. The datasets are not included in our submission due to their large size.

The second is"src". This contains two folders, "spark" and "hadoop". These folders contain the scripts we used for testing spark and hadoop, respectively.

To run the spark code, edit the paremeters passed to the main() method as needed. We ran each test by editing these parameters.
